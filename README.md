# Games-project
This is my beginner level project of learning webdev. I made this webpage of few games. (As of now it only has rock paper scissors)

- Implemented full Rock paper scissors game logic
- Added score tracking (wins, losses, ties)
- Applied glassmorphism styling
- Set up placeholder sections for future games
- Implemented a number guessing game.
- Guess history feature

I know there is a better way of implementing those logics rather than stacking if else if.. but I am still learning!
